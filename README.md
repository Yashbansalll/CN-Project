Web proxy Server

CHANGES:
To run the code, we need to use python platform.
This code is mainly used for HTTP websites in Firefox.
In Firefox, there are some setting changes.
Settings-> General -> Network settings-> Manual Proxy.
In HTTP Proxy-> Set port number and add as local host.
We have to select SOCKS v4 and then click OK.
Our code should be saved as ProxyServer.py
